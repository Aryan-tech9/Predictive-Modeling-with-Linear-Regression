# Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression



## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a predictive model using linear regression. The goal is to predict a numerical outcome based on one or more features. Specifically, this project uses the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle, which contains a continuous target variable representing housing prices.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing Prices dataset, available on Kaggle. This dataset includes various features such as the median income, house age, average rooms, average bedrooms, population, and other geographic and demographic factors that may influence housing prices.
## Features

1. 𝗠𝗲𝗱𝗜𝗻𝗰 : Median income in the block group.
2. 𝗛𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗔𝗴𝗲 : Median house age in the block group.
3. 𝗣𝗼𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 : Population in the block group.
4. 𝗟𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗱𝗲 : Latitude of the block group.
5. 𝗟𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗱𝗲 : Longitude of the block group.
## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-modeling-linear-regression.git

```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd predictive-modeling-linear-regression

```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Results

The linear regression model provides insights into how different features impact housing prices. The model's performance metrics and visualizations of predictions versus actual values can be found in the Jupyter notebook.


## Conclusion

This project showcases the process of building a predictive model using linear regression, from data preprocessing and feature selection to model training and evaluation. It serves as a practical example for beginners in machine learning and data science.
